There are four sections to complete with a robot tutor to guide you as you learn with feedback on your progress at the end of each level. The levels include : \n\n• Lathe Overview: Identify different lathe parts and related tools\n• Lathe safety: Guided tour of how to use the lathe\n• Turn a work piece: Machine a work piece and learn to use the lathe practically \n• Missions: Select a template then make and save it\n\n* The Lathe Safety Simulator game is an entertainment product. When using a Lathe ensure you are fully trained, supervised and authorised to use the equipment and comply with all health and safety regulations.

This game and the Lift Coach: Plan Your Route game are part of CPWR-The Center for Construction Research and Training’s BEST BUILT PLANS: BUILD SAFETY INTO EVERY JOB, which focuses on ways to prevent injuries from manually lifting and moving construction materials.\n\nIn the Lift Coach: Plan Your Lift game, players can correct the on-screen character in the act of lifting and moving an object. The goal is to avoid actions that can increase the risk of being hurt, such as lifting and moving in awkward postures, bending and twisting, and overreaching. The character starts off in a neutral posture, but will switch to ones that could result in unnecessary strain. It’s up to you to notice and correct what the character is doing. You’ll need to pay attention and react quickly to avoid building up too much strain and getting injured. Levels will get harder as you progress through the game. Complete all five levels to earn all three badges.\n\nLift Coach: Plan Your Lift features:\n• 5 levels of varying difficulty plus an interactive tutorial.\n• 5+ corrective gestures to memorize and perfect.\n• Available in English and Spanish.\n• Badge earning through the Simcoach Skill Arcade.\n\nThe information in this game and the other resources in the BEST BUILT PLANS program are intended to raise awareness of the risks associated with manually lifting and moving materials and the importance of planning, and to introduce engineering controls, work practices, and lifting techniques that can help to reduce the risk for injury.','1,3',NULL,'942,943,974,975','13,26,43','37,77,78,79,148',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(268,'1,2,3,4','91','83','Personal Interplay Learning Subscription','https://www.interplaylearning.com/#','4,6','Paid','1',NULL,'Virtual learning is in high demand, but for skilled trades students, this poses a unique challenge.
